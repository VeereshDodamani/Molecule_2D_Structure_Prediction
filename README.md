# This is a segment of my project where I am making a MODEL which can predict the 2D structure of the molecule provided.
This project uses GPT-2 and RDKit to generate new molecule structures based on a given SMILES string. It fine-tunes GPT-2 on a small dataset of SMILES strings and then generates new molecules.

## What is this project about?
**SMILES strings:** These are special codes that represent molecules. For example, CCO is the SMILES string for ethanol.

**GPT-2:** A language model that can generate text.

**RDKit:** This is a toolkit that helps us work with molecules. It can turn SMILES strings into images of the molecules.

## This project:

Fine-tunes GPT-2 on a small dataset of SMILES strings.

Generates new SMILES strings using the fine-tuned model.

Displays the generated molecules as images.
